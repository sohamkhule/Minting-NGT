# MINTING-NFT

This contract provides a basic functionality about creating a token, management and tracking of balance.

Token Name : "PUSH" is the token name(token name). And "PULL" is the token abbreviation(tokenAbbvr.)
Total Supply : Initial total supply (total supply) is set 0.
Balances mapping: A mapping called as "balances" is maintained in the contract, that tracks the token balances of different addresses.
Minting Tokens : The function "mint' allows to create a new token and assigns them to specified address. It updates the balance address and increase the total supply. 
Burning Tokens : The function "burn" enables the destruction of existing tokens held by a specific address. It reduces the total supply and updates the balance of the address, but only if the address, but only if the address has sufficient tokens.

## Description

A straightforward implementation of token on the Ethereum Blockchain is the "MyToken" contract. By adjusting the overall supply and individual balances, it permits the creation(minting) and destruction(burning) of tokens. It offers a fundamental framework for constructing token-related functionality on Ethereum.
